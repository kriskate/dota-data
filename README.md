# dota-data
json data for dota heroes and items

## GENERAL
Automatically generated by a service, everytime data in the lookups changes.
Data extracted from the Dota2 game files (provided by Dotabuff), on Dota2.com, and Opendota patch.json.

## Look up data:
- Heroes - stats, texts, abilities, popular items
- Items
- Patch notes
- Tips

## NOTES
- Some hero abilities (like monkey_king_primal_spring_early) do not have descriptions in the Dota2 game files, so they're skipped.
